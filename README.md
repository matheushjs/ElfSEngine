Elf Search Engine - a command-line recursive search utility

Objective
---

- From the usage perspective, the program must be similar to `grep`

- Support text files (`.txt`, `.md`)

- Support regular expressions

- Support tolerance for matching (e.g. hamming distance, language differences)

  - Or show matches in the order of similarity to the search keys given

- Support `and`, `or` directives somehow

- Don't be too slow (due to file IO)

- Support addition of entries editable with VIM
